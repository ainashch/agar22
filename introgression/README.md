# Introduction to the population genomics of introgression

### ***Part 1***
1. **Populations and genealogies**
    - Introduction to Wright-Fisher models
    - Introduction to coalescent theory
    - Introduction to evolutionary forces


2. **Genetic drift**
    - Exercise: Plotting allele frequency trajectories with R
    - Introduction to FST
    - Exercise: Simulating population divergence with msprime

### ***Part 2***
3. **Gene flow (migration)**
    - Gene flow in human history
    - Exercise: Add migration to msprime model
    - Exercise: Add admixed population to msprime model


4. **Inferring gene flow, admixture, introgression**
    - Global and local ancestry
    -	Exercise: Running ADMIXTURE, RFMix
    -	Exercise: Calcuating D statistics and Pattersonâ€™s F statistics
